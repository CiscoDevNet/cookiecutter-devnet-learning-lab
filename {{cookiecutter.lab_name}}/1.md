# Template For A Lab In DevNet Learning Labs

(The title above should match the "Title" in the JSON file)

Lorem ipsum... in a very short sentence - **less than 25 words** - state in **general terms** what this lab is about). For example: Learn how to create a script that works with technology X. Learn how to use the advanced features of tool Z.

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to show how to:

* Open an account blah-blah
* Send an API call blah-blah
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, massa ligula tellus pellentesque.
* Pellentesque ornare elit ullamcorper pellentesque vel.
* Eu malesuada laoreet, et tincidunt arcu, tellus placerat, integer proin.

## Prerequisites

Use bullet points or sub headings to list any prerequisites, such as tools that need to be installed or other labs that should be completed before starting this lab.

## Sub Heading 2 (Optional)

For any intro text that might introduce the steps use a short paragraph less than 100 words.

### Sub Heading 3 (Optional)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, massa ligula tellus pellentesque diam, per phasellus natoque etiam vel et. Pellentesque ornare elit ullamcorper pellentesque vel, facilisis lorem fermentum tellus, amet veniam soluta ut magna leo, metus donec aliquam. Lorem nunc ut eleifend quam, lacus magna sit integer orci nam, hendrerit risus quam ante vivamus feugiat, praesent faucibus, pretium donec. Aenean augue

* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet


## Step 1. Lorem Ipsum Dolor

Step 1 is the first major step. It should appear on the first page (1.md). Use action words that are imperatives, such as "Create...", "Understand...", "Set Up...", "Open...", "Define...", etc.

### Code Examples

In markdown, you have multiple options to style code including inline words or phrases or entire code snippets. For inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`. For longer blocks of code, indent with four spaces or with backticks without the indent.

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

Markdown also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines surrounded by triple backticks:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

For syntax highlighting, include the language in the top line after the three backticks.

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

```python
if choice == "you're awesome":
  print("Yes, I am awesome")
elif:
  print("No, you're awesome")
}
```

### Images

Use the following markdown syntax to add an image. Relative paths are now supported:

> `![](assets/images/image_filename.png)`

where `lab-dir-and-id` is the name of the directory containing the subdirectory assets/images.

For example, here is a test.png image:

![](assets/images/test_image.png)

Prior to March 2018, the publishing engine used to require `/posts/files` in the path in order to parse the assets and images.

If you need substeps and sequence matters, use numbered steps. Use bullet points if the sequence of steps does not matter. If the substeps amount to more than 9 steps, break up the procedure into separate major steps (put each major step on its own page).

To do blah-blah (you may have a short intro sentence to substeps):

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, massa ligula tellus pellentesque diam, per phasellus natoque etiam vel et. Pellentesque ornare elit ullamcorper pellentesque vel
  > Note: This is a note.
2. Here's a substep with an inline image.
  ![](assets/images/test_image.png)
3. Eu malesuada laoreet, et tincidunt arcu, tellus placerat, integer proin augue quis in, luctus sit integer interdum pellentesque consectetuer.
4. Links look like this: [Here is a link](http://www.cisco.com).
